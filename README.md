# data-analytics-ready
Here is a recipe to jump quickly into the data analytics using Spark, Python and VS Code with DevContainers

# Dev container base image and versions
We are using for the devcontainer a specific version of apache/spark (docker pull apache/spark:3.5.4-scala2.12-java17-python3-r-ubuntu)

Spark 3.5.4

Python 3.10

# Dev container features

There is a bunch of extensions added:

- Python (ms-python.python)
- Python Formatter (ms-python.black-formatter)
